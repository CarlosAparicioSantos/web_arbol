			<h1>Home</h1>
			<p>This is a retro web design in HTML5, I want to recreate a typical web page of 90's (approximately '97 '98). There was no javascript, tags like "<font>" or "<color>" and low quality images were used</p>
		</div>
		<div id="really">
			<h1>Really?</h1>
			<p>Yes, not al websites looked like this, but this is a little example. <br><br> <b>What is the purpose of this?</b><br><br> None, I was bored when it occurred to me to do this>:-( <br><br> <b>Hahaha, HTML5 for this sh***</b><br><br> Is thre any problem?, send me an e-mail: YouAreWastingYourTime@FakeMailService.com </p>

			<h1>This design looks like 90's</h1>
			<p> Yeah, serif font, header picture, and basic navigation bar. This reminds me a lot if you not haven't internet before 2002, yourself as the idea was, few pictures (with a speed telephone connection delayed up to two minutes to download {depending on the size})</p>
